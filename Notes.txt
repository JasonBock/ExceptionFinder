TODOs

Maybe add caching for visited methods in the view.
Need find the exception hierarchy to properly make the catch hierarchy (TypeHierarchy?)
Handle COM calls (automatically add a ComException?)
Make all of the test target methods dynamic (i.e. create the code one using Emit to have full control over the opcodes)
